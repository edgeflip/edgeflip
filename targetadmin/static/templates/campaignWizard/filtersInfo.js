  return "<div class=\"filters-help\"><p data-js=\"target-audience\"><i>Target Audience : </i> The audience segment your organization is most interested in reaching. Define your Target Audience using one or more demographic, location, and interest-based filters. For example, if your desired audience is <i>18-30 year-old men living in North Carolina</i>, then you would enable three filters -- a 'male' gender filter, a '18 - 30' age filter, and a 'State: North Carolina' location filter.    </p><p data-js=\"fallback-audience\"><i>Fallback Audiences : </i> If any of your users has fewer than 10 friends in your Target Audience, Targeted Sharing can intelligently \"fall back\" to one or more fallback audiences that employ less restrictive filters than your target audience. This lets your supporters spread your message as broadly as possible. For example, if your Target Audience is <i>18 - 30 year-old men living in North Carolina</i>, you might enable two Fallback Audiences: one to capture a larger age range (<i>18 - 50 year-old men living in North Carolina</i>) and a second to capture a larger geographic area (<i>18 - 30 year-old men living in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia</i>). Using one or more fallback audiences is entirely optional but highly recommended in most cases. To add a Fallback Audience, just click \"Add Fallback Audience.\"    </p><p data-js=\"empty-fallback\"><span class=\"fallback-subtitle\"><i>Empty Fallback : </i></span> An empty fallback audience allows Targeted Sharing to use its predictive modeling to select a user's most \"influenceable\" friends in the absence of any additional filtering. This can be useful when a supporter doesn't have any friends in your Target or Fallback Audiences. However, it doesn't always make sense to include an empty fallback: some campaigns simply won't make sense to friends outside the target audience. For instance, if you're trying to target voters in Colorado, you wouldn't want a user to share with their friends in Ohio, even if they were very influenceable.  If you're not sure whether to use an empty fallback, just <a href=\"mailto:help@edgeflip.com\" target=\"_blank\">ask us</a>.    </p></div>";
