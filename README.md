========

This repo contains the code for the edgeflip Targeted Sharing application. Below are some quick notes on getting started.

Basic Installation
------------------

Set-up for an Ubuntu 12.04 EC2 instance running Python 2.7.3. Here are some basic steps to getting up and running:

1. You'll need an SSH key with access to the edgeflip github account in ~/.ssh -- contact us if you need to get one.
2. Install minimal developer tools `sudo apt-get install git`
3. Check out the repo `git clone https://github.com/edgeflip/edgeflip.git` *All following commands are run in checkout directory.*
4. Install system dependencies: `./scripts/install-dependencies.sh`
5. Create a virtualenv (you will need to open a new terminal/shell first): `mkvirtualenv edgeflip`
6. Add your checkout to the virtualenv `add2virtualenv .`
7. Upgrade distribute: `pip install -U distribute`
8. Install python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
9. If using Apache or uWSGI, create a `edgeflip.wsgi`. Copy `templates/edgeflip.wsgi` to your deployment root (usually `/var/www/edgeflip`). Edit, replacing `$VIRTUALENV_PATH` with the full path to your virtualenv. *This is not needed if using the debug or devel server.*
10. Configure your system, as specified in the [docs](https://github.com/edgeflip/edgeflip/blob/master/doc/edgeflip.rst)
 
Local Database
--------------
To set up a local mysql database:

1. *Once only*, run `scripts/initial_db_setup.sh`. This creates an `edgeflip` database & user with a insecure default password.
2. To reset the database, use `bin/reset_db.py`. This will use your configuration values.
3. To seed the database with values for the mockclient, use `bin/mockclient_campaigns.py`. This uses the edgeflip and mockclient host data in your configuration.

Hostname Alias
--------------
Facebook requires a URL to use as a callback after auth. To point this to your local development server, add the following entry to `/etc/hosts`

```
127.0.0.1   local.edgeflip.com
```

If you are using a local virtual machine, you will need an entry in the *host* machine's `/etc/hosts` as well. Use the same line, but replace with the IP address of the VM.

Devel Server
------------
To run the server use `bin/devel_server.py`. If you need a barebones server (for use with a debugger, for example), use `bin/debug_server.py`.

Mock Client
-----------
The default configuration is written against a mock client site. You'll need to run this server as well; see the instructions in the [mockclient repo](https://github.com/edgeflip/mockclient)

Load Testing
------------
For the purposes of load testing, a POST request can be made against the /faces endpoing in a "mock mode" that will do everything but talk to facebook, instead returning a set of randomly-generated fake friend records. The following is an example of such a mock request against the local development server:

```
curl -X POST --data '{"mockmode" : "true", "fbid" : 100011235813, "token" : "IamAfakeTOKEN", "num" : 6, "sessionid" : "i-am-a-fake-session", "campaignid" : 1, "contentid" : 1}' http://local.edgeflip.com:8080/faces --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

Locally Testing a Facebook Canvas App
-------------------------------------

0. First, install the Forward client (https://forwardhq.com/in-use/facebook)
        $ gem install forward

1. Run the devel server locally (pick your favorite port or default to 8080)
        bin/devel_server.py --port 8765

2. Now, forward the the port from step 1
        $ forward 8765
        Forwarding port 8765 to https://edgeflip.fwd.wf
        Ctrl-C to stop forwarding

3. Create (or retrieve) a client in your local database that's associated with the "edgeflip local" app
        $ python bin/create_local_client.py --client-name jerkface
        client #16 jerkface:
        	https://apps.facebook.com/edgeflip-local/18/19

4. Point your browser to the link you got from step 3, and be a local hero!*
1. Make sure you have the following line in /etc/hosts:
        127.0.0.1	app.edgeflip.com
