<h2>This is the OFA landing page...</h2>
<p>It needs to conain the Facebook object headers and should also probably contain some javascript to send us click-tracking data if we're not using a redirector (hopefully FB will just drop the share's object ID in the URL and we can use that?). At any rate, it will probably contain content such as:</p>

<h3>{{ senInfo.state_name }} Residents: Tell Senator {{ senInfo.name }} It's Time for Climate Legislation!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Senator {{ senInfo.name }}</span><BR>
Email: <a href="mailto:{{ senInfo.email }}">{{ senInfo.email }}</a><BR>
Phone: {{ senInfo.phone }}
</p>
<p style="font-size:10px; margin-top: 15px;">Not in {{ senInfo.state_name }}? Click here to tell your friends.</p>
